# Etch-a-Sketch

For this project, I will be creating a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. It will be a webpage with 16x16 grid of square divs. A hover effect will be in use to change the color of the squares when the mouse enters a div. A button will also be on top of the screen that will allow users to generate a new grid depending on the number of squares entered by the user (100 limit).

This project should display my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
